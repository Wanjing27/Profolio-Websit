                <h1>Twelve</h1>
                <p>Amidst the tapestry of time, where once joy and boundless motivation painted the days in vibrant hues, a poignant transformation occurred. The canvas of laughter and affection suddenly bore the weight of sorrow and emptiness. In this poignant tale, the journey of a couple unfolds, tracing their steps from smiles to tears, encapsulating the universal truth that even the most ardent love stories must find their bittersweet conclusions.

                <p>Pain is something that anyone can feel. From accidently hitting a toe on the corner of a table or couch to neck pain from sleeping the wrong way; it is a universal concept. However, the pain one feels from heartbreak is something unique and, at times, indescribable. This is a story, based off of the song Eight by IU, about someone experiencing that pain. A recent break up has occurred. After days of sorrow, the main character finds themself casually scrolling through their instagram feed as a distraction from their pain. Everything was going well until something appeared on their feed. It was a post her ex had with his new girlfriend. They looked so happy. “Are you happy now? Finally happy now?” she asked her phone thinking he could hear her. In that moment, the main character felt like they lost everything. The one person she loved, relied on, trusted, and shared most of their life with, is gone. The person who would make them coffee in the morning, rub their back when having trouble sleeping, holding them after a nightmare, and going on random late night drives to Walmart, is gone. The love of her life leaving, made her realize that she never wants to love if this was the outcome. Feeling the large amount of pain, she wanted to travel through the beautiful, old and worn out memories they once shared. Going to her own instagram page where she did not delete any couple pictures, she scrolled down pretending he was still there. The first post she saw made her remember them dancing under the orange sun having the best day of their life. She realized that no separation was meant to be, but she wanted to continue to meet him at the memories that were once beautiful. She wished they could be forever young. Then it appeared: their anniversary picture. He went from saying he'll stay with her forever to a stranger. “If I'm in this kind of nightmare. I promise I won't wake up ever again,” she said to herself. That's when she realized the only warm thing left in her life was her bed and he was not coming back.</p>

                <p>Henriette was created around the year of 2012; its sole purpose was to standardize the street signs across the city. The typeface was available in both Heavy and Bold Condensed version in order to support short street names as well as longer ones. Over the years, Henriette has been adopted and redrawn by several enamel factories. Now, it is mostly used as headlines and logotypes for magazines and news websites due to its Roman and Italic weights. Each offers the same character set and features throughout the width spectrum: normal, condensed, compressed. This gives even more flexibility when it comes to fitting a headline or creating a logotype.
                </p>
                <p>This experimental foray into artistic expression celebrates the marriage of existing skills and the acquisition of new ones. Each element of design plays in harmony, leading the eye through a dance of discovery. The concealed letters and numbers bestow an enigmatic allure, transforming the piece into a captivating riddle for the viewer to decode.

Along with it's great drop-caps and fancy numerals, it easily becomes the star of the show in any project with the special feature of curvy and heavily circular terminal serifs and it's huge contrast of the thick downstrokes and the thin horizontal stroke. Together with it's unique elegant feet that pound terminals similar to a floral pattern, it has a feminine feel to it. This font does not have an italic type due to the fact that it's stroke already has an 60-70 degree italic angle. Unlike other modern style serif typefaces, Buttermilk's thick vertical and thin horizontal strokes create a distinctive smooth character seamlessly connected from one end to another like liquid cream. This is why it is easy to arrange it beautifully and why Hische named it Buttermilk. However, Hische's original reason for naming this font Buttermilk was because she wanted to use the tt ligature.</p>

                    As the ebb and flow of time unfolds, human existence is punctuated by myriad encounters that blur the boundaries of reality.

Expectations are repeatedly exceeded by the enchanting twists and turns life presents. This captivating image showcases a series of intricately drawn butterflies, each embodying a unique facet of existence and its transformative power. At times, reality appears almost overwhelmingly tangible, while at others, life unfurls like the pages of a wondrous fairytale.

The soft, brisk breeze caresses my face as I gently open the window, beckoning the quietude of the night to embrace me. Unfazed by the scarcity of activity, I cast my gaze into the night, curious to discover the elusive companionship of fellow sleepless souls. Amidst my observance of the world's slumber, I seize the opportunity to immortalize the tranquil perspective of one wrestling with insomnia at the solitary hour of 3 am.

She is often paired with Vi, acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature. Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn’s most powerful weapon is her superior intellect, which allows her to lay elaborate traps for any lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.

                <p>Drawn from the wellspring of inspiration sparked by a woman of unparalleled intellect, this artwork weaves a narrative of brilliance and empowerment. At the tender age of 14, she unearthed the treasure of her investigative prowess, a gift that would shape her destiny as a sheriff. In her hands, an unparalleled rifle becomes an instrument of justice, safeguarding the innocent and apprehending wrongdoers, a visual ode to her unwavering commitment to upholding the balance of justice.

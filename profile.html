        <p>As a Technology Associate at Simmons University, I have gained hands-on experience in building user interfaces and 
            honed my skills in design and coding. I have utilized languages such as HTML, Typescript, JavaScript, Java, Python,
             and Angular to fix bugs, implement UI enhancements, and build software. My expertise in Angular was particularly 
             demonstrated during my contribution to the development of a productivity app for Staples, where I met deadlines, 
             paid meticulous attention to detail, and produced high-quality code.
        </p>

        <p>I also have a passion for design and web development has always held a special place in my heart. I discovered the magical ability to express my ideas and inspirations through digital design and coding, transforming concepts into interactive artworks. Pursuing my interest further, I pursued a major in Computer Sciences and Web Design and Development at Simmons University, where I gained hands-on experience in building user interfaces and honing my skills in design and coding.
